This project is based on CHARMM36m and CHARMM-IFF force fields. GROMACS software was used for the simulation.

1. Retrieve the coordinate and topology files for 1,2-DCE through CHARMM GUI.

1.1 First of all we'll use [Ligand Reader & Modeler](https://www.charmm-gui.org/?doc=input/ligandrm) to yield all the files we need for the DCE model.
   We'll type "DCE" into "Load Ligand ID" box and the GUI will do the rest. Then we download the .tgz archive, it contains all the files we'll need further.

1.2
